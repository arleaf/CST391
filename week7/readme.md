### Summary
In this part of the Activity, I have updated the Single Album View to show the tracks. Upon clicking a track, the lyrics and video link will be displayed as shown above. I did this by creating the new components TrackLyrics, TrackTitle, TrackList, TrackVideo, and Track and updating the onClick and handlers for these components. This really put my knowledge of props and state to the test.
